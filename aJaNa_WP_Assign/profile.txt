Prajyoti Niketan (Pra : Supreme, Jyoti : Light, Niketan : Centre) = Centre of the Supreme Light is a vision of Redeeming Love (God) as Light for life involved in daily struggles, and through them called to grow greater than one’s natural size to divine size (Mt.5.48), e.g. Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Theresa, in the process of becoming original responses to God’s Call, so that the sick, homeless, marginalized (Mt.25.35ff.) and those who generously respond to their cry may have life in its fullness/ wholeness (Jn.10.10).
<br><br>
Prajyoti Niketan is an International Centre for Research, Training and Service in Wholistic approach. It is a Registered Christian Charitable Society (Regd.N.806/91). Prajyoti Niketan Society owns and manages its College. In 1994, Dr.K.R.Narayanan, the then Vice-President of India laid the Foundation Stone for Prajyoti Niketan and in 1996, Dr.Sankar Dayal Sharma, the then President of India initiated our Holistic Health Care Facility.
<br><br>
The University of Calicut sanctioned Prajyoti Niketan College in 1994. But with the Govt. concurrence we could start it only in 1995. We sensed that courses that are career specific would cause unemployment. Hence, we set up mainly service-oriented and entrepreneurial courses to supply jobs and encourage healthy progress. By dint of hard work our students stand to gain as our Vision, Mission and values shape everything to their advantage; because, from the very inception of this College Holistic Approach had been declared our main thrust. In a concentric move upward through every dimension of life the continuum they form in one’s life make up the basis for total and self-confident growth. In Holistic approach the whole is greater than the sum total of all its parts put together; i.e. the greater powers of a wholesome personality compared to its unwholesome state. It can be written as “Holistic” (Greek) or as “Wholistic” (English).
<br><br>
Dr.Fr.Harshajan Pazhayattil, the Founder-Director of Prajyoti Niketan College is the only one in Asia with a Doctorate in Holisitc approach under Dr.Rollo May (USA), its very Founder. In 2008, J.C.Intern’l conferred on Dr.Fr.Harshajan the award for the best College in the region.

<h1>Our Mission</h1>
At Prajyoti education means empowerment and formation of the whole person
Through our unique Holistic approach within Redeeming Love (God); 
Where science and creativity meet truth, wisdom & excellence for total growth
Through social justice, environmental protection and National integration.
Where knowledge incubated is disseminated in rural farms and factories
And marketed by ‘jana’ corporates to become synergy for total progress;
Where at the obsequies of the obsolete newer research paradigms and skills emerge
To tryst with systems shifts, new markets and changing milieu;

Where our youth become researchers and pioneers as original responses to God’s Call
And through daily struggles, grow greater than their natural size to divine size.
Where “the least” and the most fortunate, the male and female become complementary
To realize the rhythm of Love (Mt.25.35 ff.) through the economy of liberation
