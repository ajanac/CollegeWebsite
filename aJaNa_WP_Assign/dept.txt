                  The Department offers B.Sc Computer Science main (aided) from 1995 and Computer Applications subsidiary from 2000 onwards for both men and women.The B.Sc programme offers Mathematics and Statistics as complementary subjects. The examination pattern includes both internal and external evaluation. Choice based credit cum semester system has been introduced in the academic year 2009-2010.The Computer Science department conducts a UGC Career Oriented add-on Certificate Course in Web Technology since 2007. This is a one year course which can be pursued along with the degree course by students. Students can therefore obtain dual qualifications simultaneously. The course on web technology is open to students of other streams in the college as well as eligible students from outside the college.

Choice Based Credit cum Semester System has been introduced in the academic year 2009-2010.This course familiarizes the student of Psychology with the most essential fundamental 
Physiological processes underlying psychological events. Psychology is an academic and applied discipline that involves the scientific study of mental functions and behaviors. Psychology has the immediate goal of understanding individuals and groups by both establishing general principles and researching specific cases, and by many accounts it ultimately aims to benefit society. In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist, and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie certain cognitive functions and behaviors.

start his/her own work as Electronic circuit Designer, Electronics consultant, Testing professional, Service engineer  and even an entrepreneur in electronic industry.To train students to a level where they can readily compete for seats for 
advanced degree courses like MSc (Electronics) and MBA etc.Candidate of admission to the B.Sc Electronics Programme should have passed 
the Higher secondary / Technical higher secondary / Vocational Higher 
secondary examinations of Govt. of Kerala or CBSE or IELE or any other 
examinations recognized as equivalent there to by the University of Calicut 
with Mathematics or Computer Science or Computer Applications as one of the 
optional subjects. Electronics is the branch of physics, engineering and technology dealing with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and is usually applied to information and signal processing. Similarly, the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a working system.
